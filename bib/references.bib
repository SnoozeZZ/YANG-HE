  abstract = {With the advent of off-the-shelf intelligent home products and broader internet adoption, researchers increasingly explore smart computing applications that provide easier access to health and wellness resources. AI-based systems like chatbots have the potential to provide services that could provide mental health support. However, existing therapy chatbots are often retrieval-based, requiring users to respond with a constrained set of answers, which may not be appropriate given that such pre-determined inquiries may not reflect each patient's unique circumstances. Generative-based approaches, such as the OpenAI GPT models, could allow for more dynamic conversations in therapy chatbot contexts than previous approaches. To investigate the generative-based model's potential in therapy chatbot contexts, we built a chatbot using the GPT-2 model. We fine-tuned it with 306 therapy session transcripts between family caregivers of individuals with dementia and therapists conducting Problem Solving Therapy. We then evaluated the model's pre-trained and the fine-tuned model in terms of basic qualities using three meta-information measurements: the proportion of non-word outputs, the length of response, and sentiment components. Results showed that: (1) the fine-tuned model created more non-word outputs than the pre-trained model; (2) the fine-tuned model generated outputs whose length was more similar to that of the therapists compared to the pre-trained model; (3) both the pre-trained model and fine-tuned model were likely to generate more negative and fewer positive outputs than the therapists. We discuss potential reasons for the problem, the implications, and solutions for developing therapy chatbots and call for investigations of the AI-based system application.},

  abstract = {For using software applications, user interfaces that can be used includes command line, graphical user interface (GUI), menu driven, form-based, natural language, etc. The mainstream user interfaces include GUI and web-based, but occasionally the need for an alternative user interface arises. A chatbot based conversational user interface fits into this space. The chatbot is a class of bots that have existed in the chat platforms. The user can interact with them via graphical interfaces or widgets, and the trend is in this direction. They generally provide a stateful service i.e. the application saves data of each session. On a college’s website, one often doesn’t know where to search for some kind of information. It becomes difficult to extract information for a person who is not a student or employee there. The solution to these comes up with a college inquiry chat bot, a fast, standard and informative widget to enhance college website’s user experience and provide effective information to the user. Chat bots are an intelligent system being developed using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. It has an effective user interface and answers the queries related to examination cell, admission, academics, users’ attendance and grade point average, placement cell and other miscellaneous activities.},

  abstract = {To assist personalized healthcare of elderly people, our interest is to develop a virtual caregiver system that retrieves the expression of mental and physical health states through human–computer interaction in the form of dialogue. The purpose of this paper is to implement and evaluate a virtual caregiver system using mobile chatbot. Unlike the conventional health monitoring approach, our key idea is to integrate a rule-based virtual caregiver system (called “Mind Monitoring” service) with the physical, mental, and social questionnaires into the mobile chat application. The elderly person receives one question from the mobile chatbot per day, and answers it by pushing the optional button or using a speech recognition technique. Furthermore, a novel method is implemented to quantify the answers, generate visual graphs, and send the corresponding summaries or advice to the specific elder. In the experimental evaluation, we applied it to eight elderly subjects and 19 younger subjects within 14 months. As main results, its effects were significantly improved by the proposed method, including the above 80% in the response rate, the accurate reflection of their real lives from the responses, and high usefulness of the feedback messages with software quality requirements and evaluation. We also conducted interviews with subjects for health analysis and improvement.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are dialog engines for interactive user experience which help by providing stakeholders such as consumers, device owners, maintenance workers, and so on with real-time tools (answers to any questions, instructions to use the equipment, help for decisions, etc.). Nowadays, chatbot usage is not only for closed domain needs but has also become common across companies. Some businesses use chatbots for their customer support to provide details for the client and also to allow online transactions. It is crucial that businesses should not look at chatbots simply as a digital medium for advertisement. They should be focusing on the part of the Chatbot communication service. To improve the interaction of chatbot communication service, a blended skill chatbot was proven to have a great performance which also having an inference, personalization, empathy, and knowledge.

  abstract = {The information about affective states in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is difficult to obtain as they usually suffer from deficits in facial expression. Affective state conditions of individuals with ASD were associated with impaired regulation of speech, communication, and social skills leading towards poor socio-emotion interaction. It is conceivable that the advance of technology could offer a psychophysiological alternative modality, particularly useful in persons who cannot verbally communicate their emotions as affective states such as individuals with ASD. The study is focusing on the investigation of technology-assisted approach and its relationship to affective states recognition. A systematic review was executed to summarize relevant research that involved technology-assisted implementation to identify the affective states of individuals with ASD using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. The output from the online search process obtained from six publication databases on relevant studies published up to 31 July 2020 was analyzed. Out of 391 publications retrieved, 20 papers met the inclusion and exclusion criteria set in prior. Data were synthesized narratively despite methodological and heterogeneity variations. In this review, some research methods, systems, equipment and models to address all the related issues to the technology-assisted and affective states concerned were presented. As for the consequence, it can be assumed that the emotion recognition with assisted by technology, for evaluating and classifying affective states could help to improve efficacy in therapy sessions between therapists and individuals with ASD. This review will serve as a concise reference for providing general overviews of the current state-of-the-art studies in this area for practitioners, as well as for experienced researchers who are searching for a new direction for future works.},
